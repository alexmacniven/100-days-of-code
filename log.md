## Day 7: July 5th 2020

### Today's Progress
Continued studying Functional Programming including `map`, `filter`, and `slice` implementation.

### Thoughts
`Array.prototype` functions and arrow functions are becoming *a lot* clearer with regular usage.

## Day 8: July 6th 2020

### Today's Progress
Applied higher-order functions to solve problems and studied the `sort` functionality.

### Thoughts
I'm becoming more confident in problem solving using the built-in array methods.

## Day 9: July 7th 2020

### Today's Progress
Studied the functionality of array splitting and joining. 
Also implemented currying and partial application.

### Thoughts
I'm keen on partial application, it looks like it could be used to pass default arguments to function in a clean way.

## Day 13: July 12th 2020

### Today's Progress
I worked solely on a solution to [Smallest Common Multiple](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/smallest-common-multiple)

### Thoughts
Definitely the most challenging thus far.
My solution maybe a convoluted, I should post on the forums for feedback.
